# cobalt_aliases
Tired of typing execute-assembly everytime you use Cobalt Strike?  Clone this.  For instance, instead of "execute-assembly /opt/exe/Rubeus.exe (args) you can just type "rubeus (args)..... Template was created by 0xthirteen at Specter Ops.  All I did was copy and paste things.

These templates assume your C# files are in /opt/exe/ please change according to your environment.
